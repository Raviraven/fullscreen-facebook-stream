# Fullscreen facebook stream

## General info
Chrome extension created for maximizing facebook stream and hiding chat inside chrome browser.

## Setup
1. Download repository  
2. Go into chrome > extenstions (enter below url)  
      ```
      chrome://extensions
      ```
3. Set developer mode to true and load downloaded extension.  
4. You're ready to go! ðŸ˜‰  

### Short story behind creation
I don't really like streams in a small window with visible chat and description on facebook, and...I don't like exactly fullscreened streams.
So I decided to write an extension to maximize stream window inside chrome browser and hide chat and stream description. 

Single click on extension during watching a stream - maximizes it, second click returns it back to normal.
