# Fullscreen facebook stream

Chrome extension created during watching stream on facebook...I don't really like streams in a small window with visible chat and description on facebook, and...I don't like exactly fullscreened streams.
So I decided to write an extension to maximize stream window inside chrome browser and hide chat and stream description. 

Single click on extension during watching a stream - maximizes it, second click returns it back to normal.
